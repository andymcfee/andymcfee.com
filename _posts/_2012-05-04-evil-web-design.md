At work, we have a very basic internal HTML page that we use to list out our staging servers so that developers can see what is currently staged on what server.  It looks like this:

<iframe src="http://dabblet.com/gist/2577227" style="width:100%;height:300px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

How boring.

I quickly found the obviously developer-created stylesheet and began to manipulate it about once a week to spice things up a bit. It didn't take long for the devs to start to notice my "improvements." At first, I stuck to just livening things up with some gradients:

<iframe src="http://dabblet.com/gist/2577295" style="width:100%;height:300px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

A few easily impressed developers later and my ego swelled to dangerous proportions. But I couldn't stop there. No, not by a long shot. How does the old saying go? "He who controls the CSS controls the world?" Something like that.

Enter animations:

<iframe src="http://dabblet.com/gist/2577324" style="width:100%;height:300px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Now I've struck fear into their hearts. They see now what I'm really capable of and are much more weary of my abilities.  I can only handle their complaints about "not being able to click the links" for so long.

Fine, but be careful what you wish for...

"Andy, I hate you." -The Dev Team.  Yes, my thirst for total domination of their staging page was nearly quenched.  Now my game is transitioning into an artform of evil.  My only mantra is how I can use my CSS to annoy them more than the last attempt.

I decided to step up the overall look of the page a bit with some pastels and a nice, subtle hover animation...

<iframe src="http://dabblet.com/gist/2576097" style="width:100%;height:300px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

"But the animation only lasts a few seconds and you only get the full effect with Chrome and Safari!" I know, my evil shoulder devil said the same thing. Apparently the devs aren't quick enough with a mouse to accurately click the link they wanted and I didn't want to spend the time making it work perfectly in Firefox. Excuses.

So what lies in store? What CSS technique will I exploit next? Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise...

...but probably media-queries.  Muahahahahahah!!!
