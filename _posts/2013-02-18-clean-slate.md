Well, I've done it again. I've redesigned my site/blog.

Actually, I've done much more than just redesign: I've rebuilt my entire site using Jekyll.  WordPress was just overkill for what I needed and Jekyll gives me so much more control over everything about my site.
No more PHP.  No more database. Just HTML, CSS and JS.  Me likey.

Ready... Set...
=================

The move to Jekyll wasn't completely painless.  I didn't have much success with any of the [conversion tools][1] out there, but I only have a handful of blog posts so converting them manually was simple enough.

The majority of my time was spent "redesigning" and by "redesigning" I mean constantly changing colors til I was happy.

I finally made myself commit to where I'm at now and push out an MVP version of my site, which I"m actually pretty happy with.  I'll add new pages/features/functionality as I have time to do so and I'll let it grow organically over time.

But my goal is to not fully redesign again for a long time.  At least a year.  But I'll continue to modify and update as I go along.

Behind The Curtain
================

And in the interest of transparency, my entire blog is available on [GitHub][2] for anyone to check out.  If you're thinking of moving to or starting a Jekyll-based blog or site, have a look to see how things are structured.

Well, that's all I've got for now.
