A buddy of mine recently had the opportunity to go to SXSW a few weeks ago.  I was insanely jealous (and furious when he complained afterwards about it "not really being his thing"... what an ass).

I've never been to a real web conference, mainly because the opportunity has never really presented itself.  Sure, I've attended conferences, but only ones hosted by company's to promote themselves (*cough* [Silverpop][] *cough*).  But I haven't had the opportunity to go to a real conference about my industry, namely, the Web Design and Development.

So when my employer said I should find some conferences that interest me, I immediately started my research.  I found [this fantastic list][] of web design and development conferences from Smashing Magazine.  Here's my short-list of those most focused on front-end development, UI/UX and HTML5/CSS3 along with my thoughts and a 10-point score for how badly I'd like to go.

##### June 14-15 - Reasons to be Creative – New York
[http://www.reasonstobecreative.com/][] $399 ($499 after June 1) “Reasons to be Creative is a festival for creative artists, designers and coders. The festival brings together some of the most respected and brilliant minds from the worlds of art, code, design and education to share their passion, knowledge, insights and work. Expect two days packed with talks, networking, inspiration and learning.” **Too soon to tell, lots of great speakers, but only 3 of their sessions are outlined so far. Looks promising though. Great price and in NYC. **SCORE: TBD****
##### May 26-27 - UXCAMP Europe - Berlin
[http://www.uxcampeurope.org/][http://www.uxcampeurope.org/] ??? (goes on sale April 3) "Following the huge success of the UXcamp Europe in 2010 &amp; 2011, the next camp will take place in Berlin May 26-27 2012. The focus of the event will be on Information Architecture, Interaction Design, Usability Engineering, Visual Design, Prototype Engineering, UI Development" **More of a social conference from what I can tell, not big on speakers.  Topics are spot-on, but I it looks more like a workshop-focused Hack Day than an actual conference but I could be completely wrong. Still... **SCORE: 6****
##### May 16-18 - UXLX - Lisbon
[http://www.ux-lx.com/][http://www.ux-lx.com/] €854.85 (mostly soldout) "3 fantastic days with User Experience Professionals from all the over the world. 16 workshops to develop your skills, 10 talks to inspire you and 16 slots open for you to share your experiences. All this coupled with lots of parties and meetups in sunny Lisbon." **It’s already pretty much sold-out but still seems very interesting. **SCORE: 8****
##### July 31-Aug 2 - CSS Summit - ONLINE
[http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/css-summit/][http://environmentsforhumans.com/2012/css-summit/] $499 "Environments for Humans brings together some of the Web's most notable experts in CSS3 and SASS for an all-new, three-day online conference, the CSS Summit 2012! Bring the experts to your desktop July 31-August 2, 2012 from 9AM to 4PM (CT)." **No brainer. Great speakers, all CSS, all online.  Time Zones may be an issue. Conference would start late afternoon and go into the night. **SCORE: 9, maybe 7 if they can't handle the Time Zone issue well.****
##### May 9-11 - Mobilism - Amsterdam
[http://mobilism.nl/][http://mobilism.nl/] €350 workshop +  €600 2-day conference "Mobilism aims to help web designers and developers make the jump from desktop to mobile by offering industry-leading conferences and workshops; primarily in Europe." **After reading the talk summaries, this looks like a really great conference for anyone interested in anything mobile, from design to development and more (even if just for the conference). SCORE: 9**
##### April 26-27 - Front-Trends - Warsaw
[http://2012.front-trends.com/][http://2012.front-trends.com/] Sold Out.  Dammit. "This is a gathering for front-end lovers to discover the current trends to build a professional career out of innovative front-end development." **Would LOVE to go to this one. It’s the perfect conference for me.  Really wish I had learned about this one sooner. SCORE**: 10****
##### May 14-16 - Future of Web Design - London
[http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2012/][http://futureofwebdesign.com/london-2012/] £834.00 "The Future of Web Design proudly presents three days of cutting edge learning and inspiration. Join us for a day of in-depth workshops, followed by two action-packed conference days in the heart of London!" **Very HTML5/CSS3 focused. Great workshops, GREATER talks. **SCORE: 10****
##### July 4-7 - Webvisions - Barcelona
[http://www.webvisionsevent.com/barcelona/][http://www.webvisionsevent.com/barcelona/] €550 (with Workshop) "Three fantastic days with User Experience Professionals from all the over the world. 16 workshops to develop your skills, 10 talks to inspire you and 16 slots open for you to share your experiences. All this coupled with lots of parties and meetups in sunny Lisbon." **GREAT list of Workshops and sessions.  Very UX/Responsive Web/CSS3 focused. **SCORE: 10****
##### Aug 21-24 - UX Week - San Fran
[http://uxweek.com/2012/][http://uxweek.com/2012/] $2,195.00 (HOLY HELL!) "Environments for Humans brings together some of the Web's most notable experts in CSS3 and SASS for an all-new, three-day online conference, the CSS Summit 2012! Bring the experts to your desktop July 31-August 2, 2012 from 9AM to 4PM (CT)." **OK, I know. This one is a bit unreasonable but from everything I can tell about it, it's the Holy Grail of front-end design and development conferences.  It's definitely been around longer than most (10 years)  SCORE: 11**

**WINNER: TIE - Webvisions in Barcelona and The Future of Web Design in London -** UX Week is just too expensive and Front-Trends would have taken the gold if it weren't sold out at the time of this writing.  Webvisions and TFWD both look to have great speaker and session line-ups with strong focuses on front-end dev.

**RUNNER-UP: Mobilism in Amsterdam -** The hyper-focused topic of pure mobile is very appealing as someone who is currently doing a lot of development for mobile.  Mobile is still very young and there is so much still to learn, I think this would be a very beneficial and interesting conference.

So there you go.  What do you think? Have you been to any of these or know anything about it?  Did I overlook a particularly good one? Let me know!
