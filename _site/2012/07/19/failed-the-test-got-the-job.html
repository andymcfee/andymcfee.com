A year ago today, I had an interview for a job as a front end developer. At the start of the interview, I was informed that this position required a substantial knowledge of javascript. Sure enough, I was asked to take a test. I was screwed.

I was very upfront about my javascript skills and even as I started the test, I assured my interviewer/potential boss that I would most definitely fail. I was able to manipulate and work with javascript easily enough, but ask me to write a function from scratch (with no help from Google) and I was completely lost. I think I got something like 8/20 questions correct (it was a multiple choice test), and even then, no less than 6 of them were just lucky guesses.

The interview continued and I tried to sell myself on my other skills.  I was naturally very passionate talking about HTML, CSS, UI, UX and web design and tried to be as positive as possible, despite my dismal performance on the test which had been immediately graded right after I finished.

Well, I ended up getting the job anyway.  Sort of.  When I heard back about the job, they told me that while I wasn't really a fit for the javascript developer role (obviously), they thought I could still be an asset to the company in a slightly different role.  My passion for my work and my drive to always want to learn more had gotten me the job.

I've been with Official.fm for almost a year now after failing that js test. I guess the moral of the story is that a strong passion learning new things is almost as important and any specific requirement on a job posting.  Don't sell yourself short and love what you do and you can't fail.  

Well, except for a javascript test.  You could still fail that.
